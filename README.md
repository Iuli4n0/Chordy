# Chordy
Chord algorithm implementation.
A distributed hash table (DHT) works by assigning keys to different nodes in a distributed system. A node will store the values corresponding to the key assigned to it. One of the applications of DHTs is peer-to-peer file-sharing systems. One such design for a DHT is Chord. The application implements a peer-to-peer system that provides the functionality to store key-value pairs.
Compile using openssl, sqlite3 and pthreads.
